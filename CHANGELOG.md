All notable changes to the OpenClaw Android Installer will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2026.2.10] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
-  **CRITICAL**: Fixed `pkg upgrade` hanging on interactive prompts (dpkg config file conflicts)
  - Now uses `apt-get upgrade` with `--force-confold` to avoid prompts
  - Sets `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` to prevent any interactive dialogs
-  Fixed `df: Unknown option 'm'` error on some Termux versions
  - Changed from `df -m` to `df -k` (more universally supported)
  - Added proper validation and error handling for storage check
-  Fixed version comparison validation
  - Added regex validation to ensure version format is correct (e.g., 2026.2.10)
  - Only uses first line from VERSION file to prevent concatenation
  - Better handling of malformed version responses
-  Fixed "integer expression expected" error when storage check fails
  - Added proper null/empty checks before numeric comparisons
  - Fallback to user confirmation if storage can't be determined
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed "nvm: command not found" error during Node.js installation
  - Added multiple fallback methods to load NVM
  - Improved NVM sourcing with better error detection
  - Added verification steps before attempting to use nvm
  - Now tries: direct source, bashrc source, and manual load

### Changed
- Improved error messages for storage check failures
- Added user prompt to continue if storage check fails (rather than hard exit)
- Better validation of curl responses in version checking
- Enhanced NVM loading with 3-tier fallback system
- Better error messages when NVM fails to load
- Added explicit verification that nvm command is available

### Context
These fixes address issues reported by users running F-Droid Termux on Android 16. The interactive dpkg prompt was the most critical issue preventing unattended installation. After NVM installation, the script needs to explicitly source it before use. Some environments don't automatically load it, causing "command not found" errors.

## [2026.2.9] - 2026-02-13

### Added
-  **DISCLAIMER.md** - Comprehensive disclaimer clarifying project scope
-  Attribution notices in README and installer banner
-  Proper credit to OpenClaw's original creators throughout documentation
-  Updated marketing materials with attribution guidelines

### Changed
- Clarified in all documentation that this is an installer tool, not OpenClaw itself
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to specify contribution scope
- Added disclaimer notices to completion messages
- Updated README badges to show correct version (2026.2.9)

### Context
This update ensures proper attribution to OpenClaw's creators and clarifies that this project is a community-created installation tool, not the OpenClaw framework itself.

## [2026.2.8] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
-  Fixed version comparison showing incorrect concatenated versions
-  Fixed "No command y found" error when responding to prompts
-  Fixed auto-update download using /tmp (permission denied)
-  All user input prompts now use `/dev/tty` for proper input handling in Termux

### Changed
- Improved version checking with whitespace trimming
- Auto-update now downloads to `$HOME` instead of `/tmp`
- Better error handling for empty version responses

## [2026.2.7] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- Fixed "Permission denied" error when creating Debian setup script
- Changed temporary script location from `/tmp` to `$HOME` to avoid Termux permission issues
